# Game_simulations
The the files under Game_simulations are m-files required for the Monte Carlo simulation of rolling different numbers of D10s (ten sided dice). The simulation is performed by running the MC_Sim file, which requires the other m-files as supporting functions. Note the file D10 perorms the same simulation but is much less efficient.

The individual functions can be exploited for other uses in simulating dice rolls of any number of sides.
